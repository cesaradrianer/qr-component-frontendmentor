## My process

As always, I started first adding the HTML markup, and for the interesting part, I basically opened mobile-design.jpg in MS Paint to analyze things like border-radius values(I drew two circles on the corners of the component and QR image to guess them) and how big the component was. Then I just had to try to match the box-shadow look as much as I could, and finally I just added the easier styles, like Flexbox row centering and font styling.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Plain old Vanilla CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to take Front-End a little bit more seriously, I thought this would be a really easy beginner's exercise, and it would only take me about 30min to complete. I was wrong. Guessing values for small things like the border-radius and box-shadow values was not exactly easy, as that was not disclosed on the style guide.
